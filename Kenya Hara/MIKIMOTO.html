                Brand color
                <br><br>
                MIKIMOTO's brand color is 'white with expectation'-a color that represents anticipation, singing of
                happiness about to come to fruition, like a budding flower that has yet to fully bloom. It is an as-yet
                undeveloped white, rich with potential. Pearls can have various kinds of white. By using a white that
                can present many different facets, the brand color expresses the rich harvest that will eventually lead
                to the manifestation of happiness.

                The glittering waters of Ago Bay
                The packaging was designed with the glittering surface of Ago Bay as a motif. The surface of the water
                was expressed through the wrapping paper by using mica-coated paper printed with a water pattern, and
                through the packaging which uses a leatheresque, embossed material to embody a wavelike pattern.
