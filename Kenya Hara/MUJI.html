                In 2001, Kenya Hara took over the MUJI design department. He abandoned the over-packaging design style
                and advocated a simple lifestyle concept. The poster above is a collection of posters that fully
                disregards all unnecessary and strives for the highest level of simplicity. The entire image was
                captured spontaneously. In fact, this type of design is not devoid of design, but it does away with the
                unnecessary and exaggeration in favor of a condition closer to nature. From 1983 until 2003, MUJI has
                existed for 20 years. A series of Horizon posters that were published in 2003 not only promoted a new
                propaganda image but also introduced other customers to the MUJI design philosophy. Publicity activities
                basically adhere to this concept : the horizon is infinite, it is the widest line that people’s eyes can
                see, which represents the accommodation of all things in the world. Our eyesight becomes unobstructed as
                a result, allowing us to comprehend that everything in the world is visible to our eyes. Due to the
                boundaries of sea and sky are not obvious enough, the design team did not choose it as the major of the
                poster design, but chose the green grassland and white salt lake with obvious boundaries as the major of
                the shooting, which is consistent with MUJI’s “no brand” image idea.
