                Kenya himself states that he wants to “rethink and broaden the possibilities for fine paper” using
                Subtle. Some really innovative uses of paper are on display that push the limits of the medium and
                demonstrate the very subtle effect that these objects have on the viewer. The white space, which brings
                these things so near to the viewer, not only reflects the simplicity of paper but also offers a calm
                setting in which to focus on its subtle, frequently disregarded features.
