                The design of Tsutaya bookstore uses simple and clean color matching, so that readers can see at a
                glance. Psychologically, it allows readers to be immersed in it, which provides a comfortable
                environment for quiet reading and thinking. In addition, Kenya Hara is a master of using white color. He
                used a lot of blank space in his design, but it was not empty, but made the picture full of tension. The
                white in Kenya Haraâ€™s design is not colorless, empty, and mysterious, but it gives people more space for
                imagination and aftertaste. Using white makes the design create a quiet atmosphere, so that everyone can
                read books joyfully, and also let people know the story behind the brand image in a relaxed and happy
                atmosphere, so that the design can express a more unique and shocking artistic effect.
