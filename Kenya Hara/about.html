                be an
                excellent design idea. In fact, in this way we can develop habits by observing people or any small
                little things in our life, hence we can discover more design inspiration from life, so as to
                cultivate
                designers’ more acute design thinking. Besides, design is not only a designer’s self expression, it
                is
                to find out the problem and try to solve it in the process.
